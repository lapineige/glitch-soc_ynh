## Overview
Glitch-soc is a free, open-source social network. A decentralized alternative to commercial platforms, it avoids the risks of a single company monopolizing your communication. Pick a server that you trust,whichever you choose, you can interact with everyone else. Anyone can run their own Glitch-soc instance and participate in the social network seamlessly.

**Glitch-soc is a friendly fork of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), mainly similar but with some extra features.**

This app is a fork of [Yunohost Mastodon app](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mastodon_ynh), with extra changes for Glitch-soc. It will be kept up-to-date with Yunohost Mastodon repository.

**Shipped version:** 2.8.3 Mastodon equivalent

*NB: Glitch-soc doesn't provide any specific release, and is constantly updated. We try to use it at a state that correspond to the equivalent Mastodon version.*

## Configuration

#### Adding "swapfile" If you have less than 2Go of RAM
```
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1024000
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```
add this line on /etc/fstab
```
/swapfile       none    swap    sw      0       0
```

### Install

#### Domain

You can't install Glitch-soc in subdirectory, you must use a domain or subdomain for this application.

#### Using __screen__ in case of disconnect
```
sudo apt-get install screen
screen
sudo yunohost app install https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/glitch-soc_ynh.git
```
Recover after disconnect:
```
screen -d
screen -r
```
The admin user is automatically created as: user@domain.tld

### Update
#### Using __screen__ highly recommended

`sudo yunohost app upgrade --debug glitch-soc -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/glitch-soc_ynh.git`

### Migration from Mastodon

In theory, you can upgrade your mastodon instance to glitch-soc just by upgrading the sources. Then it's possible to upgrade you Mastodon Yunoost instance like this :
`sudo yunohost app upgrade --debug https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/glitch-soc_ynh`

:warning: Do that at your own risk, and make some backups first :)

## Recommendation

It seems important to close the inscriptions for your Glitch-soc, so that it remains a private body. We invite you to block remote malicious instances from the administration interface. You can also add text on your home page.

## Documentation

 * Official documentation: https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/

## YunoHost specific features

* ARMv8-A : :warning: This app can work on ARM, but installation takes several hours and you must add a swapfile of 1GB.
